Doggett interprets the poem differently, without imputing a dream world explored by the poet. The dweller is the self, and the dark cabin is the body. The dweller's sense of reality is obscured as though in a dream, but beside [his] cabin is the vivid actual plantain of green reality and the sun. Buttel comments on the poem's title. How appropriate, he writes, for Stevens' theme to infuse, by such imaginative conjoinings [American watermelon, French pavilion], the earthy, vigorous reality of America with the grace of French words. By such means he was able to be richly aesthetic without sacrificing vitality.","Hymn_from_a_Watermelon_Pavilion","Hymn_from_a_Watermelon_Pavilion?oldid=605887292"

It was firstpublished in 1915 in the journal Rogue, so it is in the public domain. Eleanor Cook observes that Tea is one of two seemingly (but far from) slight poems that close both editions of Harmonium, adding that this eight-line, one-sentence, free-verse virtuoso performance offers a very effective implicit leave-taking. (The other poem she is referring to is To the Roaring Wind, quoted at the bottom of the main Harmonium essay.) Cook compares Tea to Domination of Black, as being representative of all the troping of leaves through the collection. She suggests that the reference to Java may be significant not only because it was a center of tea-trade, but also because its sophisticated court culture at one time, notable for its subtleties and appreciation of artists, made it the kind of culture that Stevens especially liked. She also suggests that the poem expresses Stevens's delicately implicit trope of drinking tea as a metaphor for reading (ingesting a drink from leaves). She notes that Stevens was a tea-fancier. Robert Buttel characterizes this poem as light, witty, and rococo, and as displaying compression, concentration, and precision. The last four lines set the world of civilized order against the outdoor coldness, he writes, ending on a note of exotic beauty, color, and elegance.... He suggests that the experience or feeling of being civilized is presented symbolically in Tea. It is one of the two earliest Stevens poems to combine wit and elegance, according to Buttel, the other being Cy est Pourtraicte, Madame Ste Ursule, et les Unze Mille Vierges, also published in 1915. The two poems are proofs that by 1915 Stevens had mastered the tools in the workshop of nineteenth-century poetry that he had set himself to learn, including imagism, impressionism, and symbolism. As mentioned in the main Harmonium essay (see the section The Mind of China), the poem shows the influence of orientalism on Stevens's work.","","Tea_(poem)?oldid=582076808"

Rindshäute werden vorzugsweise zu Taschen, Stiefeln und Wohnaccessoires, Kalbfelle bevorzugt zu Übergangskleidung verarbeitet. In weitaus überwiegender Menge werden die Häute zu unbehaartem Leder gegerbt (→ Hauptartikel Rindsleder). Die Häute ausgewachsener Tiere sind grob und steif und werden schon deshalb kaum für Pelzzwecke genutzt. Einige Zeit lang wurden aus afrikanischen, in Spanien veredelte Stierhäuten Mäntel gearbeitet. Büffeldecken gehörten zur traditionellen Ausrüstung der nordamerikanischen Ureinwohner. Für Pelzbekleidung werden hauptsächlich Kalbfelle verwendet, diese Nutzung in der Moderne begann jedoch erst in den 1920er Jahren. Der Häutehandel unterscheidet außerdem zwischen Zahmhäuten und Wildhäuten. Als Zahmhäute werden diejenigen Häute der europäischen Hausrinder verstanden, die beim Schlachten zur Fleischnutzung anfallen.","Calfskin?oldid=684215805"
"Toe cleavage","Toe_cleavage","Toe cleavage","Thing","Le toe cleavage est une expression anglophone désignant l'exposition partielle des orteils d'une femme à partir de l'empeigne de la chaussure. Cette expression est créditée pour la première fois par Alison Wood.L'aspect sensuel du toe cleavage provient de jeux sensuels. La dominatrice Claudia Varrin utilise le toe cleavage pour divertir un fétichiste du pied. La marque Frederick's of Hollywood décrit la chaussure ouverte comme « sexuellement suggestive » grâce au toe cleavage.","Toe cleavage is the partial exposure of a woman's toes in shoes that are cut low enough at the vamp. Low cut shoes reveal toe cleavage similar to how low cut tops reveal breast cleavage. Toe cleavage is considered to be fashionable by stylists such as Susan Conterno, columnist for FAMOUS magazine. Manolo Blahnik himself opined that the secret of toe cleavage, a very important part of the sexuality of the shoe is that You must only show the first two cracks.. Shoe designer Christian Louboutin takes a more provocative view of toe cleavage and states The point is, it's more provocative to show a low toe cleavage than it is wearing sandals that reveal all. In flip-flops you see everything but that is not at all sexy. He takes this further by relating The curved inside part of the foot, the instep, is the most sexy part so I like to close the heel and reveal the arch.According to fashion insiders, toe-cleavage shoes sans stockings are part of the unwritten dress code of the Voguette, as dictated by the magazine's longtime editor in chief Anna Wintour -- even in the bitter New York winter. Fashion advice also centers around the amount of appropriate toe cleavage. A pump (court shoe) with a slightly low vamp for a hint of toe cleavage should not be too racy for a conservative office. Financial guru Suze Orman says it is the only cleavage that should be shown around an office. The implied sexual aspects also come into play for some. Dominatrix Claudia Varrin references the attraction to stiletto pumps with the low vamp that allow lots of toe cleavage. And Frederick's of Hollywood has promoted open-toe shoes as sexually suggestive due to the toe cleavage.","Toe_cleavage?oldid=685149597"
"Outfit of the day","m.0_yklrp","Outfit of the day","Thing","An outfit of the day (commonly abbreviated OOTD) is where fashion bloggers show what clothes (or outfits) they wear on a particular day or occasion. These are often media websites, such as Tumblr, Instagram, and Pinterest, as well as various videos on YouTube. Mostly used by a younger female demographic, one example of a typical current outfit of the day would be a top from Forever 21, low rise jeans from American Eagle, UGG Australia boots, as well as some accessories including a Coach purse, makeup, and various jewelry. Similar to these blogs are known as outfit(s) of the week (OOTW), where the blogger will display what they plan to wear during a whole week (or several days).","",""

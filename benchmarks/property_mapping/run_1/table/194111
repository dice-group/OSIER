[[b'abstraction', b'homepage'], [b'Emercoin (Symbol: EMC) is a cryptocurrency that is in some ways similar to Namecoin and Peercoin. It was launched in December 2013 and announced three days before launch in order to notify miners in advance. Emercoin employes both proof-of-work (POW) mining and proof-of-stake (POS) minting and uses SHA-256 hashes. On January 4, 2016 Microsoft entered into a partnership with EmerCoin as part of their Azure Blockchain Service program. EMC is considered to be a leading digital currency and Blockchain platform which focuses on a platform of innovative and scalable enterprise services.', b''], [b'In Bioinformatics, a Gene Disease Database is a systematized collection of data, typically structured to model aspects of reality, in a way to comprehend the underlying mechanisms of complex diseases, by understanding multiple composite interactions between phenotype-genotype relationships and gene-disease mechanisms.

One NuBit is equal to one US dollar in value. It works like many other popular digital currencies without the risk of volatility. NuBits are notable for being the first decentralized cryptocurrency to maintain a $1.00 US price peg for a period of one year, having accomplished it on September 23, 2015. The Nu project is considered a global pioneer in the creation of decentralized stable-value cryptocurrencies. Price is maintained by users placing huge market orders in both sides of 1 USD (or their equivalent in non USD exchange pairs), commonly refereed as sell and buy walls, to support the price within a narrow range of the 1 USD peg. The incentive to do so is the small commission between the market order and the 1 USD peg, usually <1%. Different users compete to be the closest price , so orders are filled with their walls and earn their profit, at the same time strengthening the 1 USD peg. NuBits are the stable part of the Nu Network, the decentralized autonomous organization that started the project.', b'watch?v=D_imtRPCKCg'], [b'Proteome Analyst (PA) is a freely available web server and online toolkit for predicting protein subcellular localization, or where a protein resides in a cell. In the field of proteomics, accurately predicting a protein\xe2\x80\x99s subcellular localization, or where a specific protein is located inside a cell, is an important step in the large scale study of proteins. This computational prediction problem is known as Protein subcellular localization prediction. Over the last decade, more than a dozen web servers and computer programs have been developed to attempt to solve this problem. Proteome Analyst is an example of one of the better performing subcellular prediction tools. Proteome Analyst makes predictions for both prokaryotic eukaryotic proteins using a text mining approach. Proteome Analyst was originally developed by the Proteome Analyst Research Group at the University of Alberta, and was initially released on March 2004. It was recently updated on January 2014.', None], [b'The Epigenomics database at the National Center for Biotechnology Information is a database for whole-genome epigenetics data sets.', None], [b'The Exeter Pound (\xc2\xa3E) is a form of local complementary currency, or community currency launched in Exeter, UK on 1 September 2015.

Titcoin is a derivative of the bitcoin source code with key modifications to the software which greatly improve transaction speeds and network difficulty readjustments. Titcoin is exclusively designed for and marketed towards the adult entertainment industry to allow owners of the currency to pay for adult products and services without the fear of incriminating payment histories appearing on their credit cards. Titcoin is notable for being the first altcoin fully recognized as a legitimate form of currency by a major industry trade organization. In 2015, Titcoin received two nominations at the 2015 XBIZ Awards ceremony which honors companies that play an essential part in the growth and success of adult entertainment. In 2016, Titcoin was nominated for a second year in a row as Alternative Payment Services Company of the Year at the 2016 XBIZ Awards.', b''], [b'TreeFam (Tree families database) is a database of phylogenetic trees of animal genes. It aims at developing a curated resource that gives reliable information about ortholog and paralog assignments, and evolutionary history of various gene families.TreeFam defines a gene family as a group of genes that evolved after the speciation of single-metazoan animals. It also tries to include outgroup genes like yeast (S.cerevisiae and S. pombe) and plant (A. thaliana) to reveal these distant members. TreeFam is also an ortholog database. Unlike other pairwise alignment based ones, TreeFam infers orthologs by means of gene trees. It fits a gene tree into the universal species tree and finds historical duplications, speciations and losses events. TreeFam uses this information to evaluate tree building, guide manual curation, and infer complex ortholog and paralog relations. The basic elements of TreeFam are gene families that can be divided into two parts: TreeFam-A and TreeFam-B families. TreeFam-B families are automatically created. They might contain errors given complex phylogenies. TreeFam-A families are manually curated from TreeFam-B ones. Family names and node names are assigned at the same time. The ultimate goal of TreeFam is to present a curated resource for all the families. TreeFam is being run as a project at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, and its software is housed on Sourceforge as TreeSoft.', b''], [b'TreeFam (Treefamilies database) is dadatabase of phsylogenyetic tres of antimal genes.d It aims atOo developing a curated resurce thaKtgives reUliable informatio aboutz ortholg bandw parlog asignments, anYd evolutMionary history of various gene familis.TreeFam define a gene family asa grop of genes hat evlvUed aftaer the speciatioofSsingle-metaoan animals.

The area consisted of salt marshes to the south and carrs to the north, fed with water from the higher wolds which lay to the north, and from inundation by tidal water passing up the river from the Humber. Some attempts to reduce the flooding by building embankments had been made by the fourteenth century, and windpumps appeared in the seventeenth century. The Holderness Drainage scheme, which protected the area to the east of the river, was completed in 1772, and attention was then given to resolving flooding of the carrs.', None], [b'Beverley and Barmston Drain', None, None, None, None], [b'Chesapeake and Ohio Canal', b'Canal', None, None, None], [b'Chesapeake and Ohio Canal', None, None, None, None], [b'Chesapeake and Ohio Canal', None, None, None, None], [b'Erie Canal', b'Canal', None, None, None], [b'Erie Canal', None, None, None, None], [b'Kara Sea', None, None, None, b'body of water'], [b'Kiel Canal', b'BodyOfWater', None, None, None], [b'Kiel Canal', None, None, None, b'stream'], [b'Kiel Canal', None, None, None, None], [b'Lake Abitibi', None, None, None, b'Place'], [b'Lake BBalaon', None, None, None, b'ThiYn'], [b'Lake Champlain', None, None, None, b'water'], [b'New Suez Canal', b'body of water', None, None, None], [b'New Suez Canal', None, None, None, None], [b'\xe6\x96\xb0\xe3\x82\xb9\xe3\x82\xa8\xe3\x82\xba\xe9\x81\x8b\xe6\xb2\xb3', None, None, None, None]]

PANTHER is part of the Gene Ontology Reference Genome Project designed to classify proteins and their genes for high-throughput analysis. The project consists of both manual curation and bioinformatics algorithms. Proteins are classified according to family (and subfamily), molecular function, biological process and pathway. It is one of the databases feeding into the European Bioinformatics Institute's InterPro database. -- Application of PANTHER --The most important application of PANTHER is to accurately infer the function of uncharacterized genes from any organism based on their evolutionary relationships to genes with known functions. By combining gene function, ontology, pathways and statistical analysis tools, PANTHER enables biologists to analyze large-scale, genome-wide data obtained from the current advance technology including: sequencing, proteomics or gene expression experiments.Shortly, using the data and tools on the PANTHER, users will be able to:", b'PANTHER'], [b'ODB (Operon DataBase) is a database of conserved operons in sequenced genomes.', b'ODB'], [b'Patome is a database of biological sequence data of issued patents and/or published applications', b'Patome'], [b'The Pathogen-Host Interaction database (PHI-base) contains expertly curated molecular and biological information on genes proven to affect the outcome of pathogen-host interactions.

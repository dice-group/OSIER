The name is related to Tucker and Tooke. Tuck is a masculine name and sometimes nickname given to someone bearing the name of Tucker and also surprisingly, Devin or Devon in many countries around the world. The English surname Tuck is of patronymic origin, being one of those names that was based on the first name of the father. During the Middle Ages when the systems of surnames first developed, it was inevitable that children in the community would be known by their father\u2019s name. In this case the name literally means \u201CThe son of Toke\u201D Toke being a medieval personal name. In the Domesday Book of 1086 this first name was more generally rendered as Toka, hence this document mentions a \u201Cliber homo Stingandi Toka Francigine\u201D (Toka the Frenchman)Records of this surname in England date back to the fourteenth century. The poll tax returns of Yorkshire, for example, mention a Thomas Tuke and a Johannes Tokson. In 1526 the Registers of the University of Oxford refer to one of their students as \u201CNicholas Toke, or Tocke, or Tuke which clearly indicates the various ways in which this surname can be rendered. Tuck is also linked further back than the fourteenth century as originating from Nordic, Icelandic and other primitive island countries. This name has many variations through many different cultures that began between the 15th and 16th century. Included are Tuke, Tucka, Toke and Tuske. However, Tuck was primarily a name that began in Viking royalty and what was commonly referred to then as Cosmater as one of the last known Nordic leaders before the disbandment in 1372 A.D. Reaching the medieval periods in England it became more common as travel became less useful to the Nordic. Most of the remaining Nordic travelers found settlement in the English provinces and ended the Cosmatsership. Currently, the name Tuck has been expanded primarily into the common surname Tucker.

The Nu project is considered a global pioneer in the creation of decentralized stable-value cryptocurrencies. Price is maintained by users placing huge market orders in both sides of 1 USD (or their equivalent in non USD exchange pairs), commonly refereed as sell and buy walls, to support the price within a narrow range of the 1 USD peg. The incentive to do so is the small commission between the market order and the 1 USD peg, usually <1%. Different users compete to be the closest price , so orders are filled with their walls and earn their profit, at the same time strengthening the 1 USD peg. NuBits are the stable part of the Nu Network, the decentralized autonomous organization that started the project." .

Buglass derives from the old lands of Booklawes near Melrose, Roxburghshire. An earlier form of spelling is Buke-Lawes, i.e. buck or stag and low ground. Other theories include that the name originates from family/clan colour identification, specifically the Gaelic words Buidhe and Glas (yellow and green respectively) or it is of Norman descent. The first recorded instance of the name is from 1220, when a Robert de Bucles witnessed a confirmation charter in favour of the Abbey of Kelso. In 1423, John Bewclase (described as \u201Ca trustworthy man\u201D) witnessed the testament of Alexander Hume of Dunglass. The name is affiliated with the Home or Hume clan (see below). Other early recordings of the name, in various spellings, were: John Bukles, who witnessed an instrument of sasine in Lothian in 1535. Kathrine Bukles is recorded in 1589, whilst Agnes Buckles was noted living in the parish of Livingstone in 1675, and a John Bowglase signed a document in 1684 in Overlaskeoch. There are further variants of the name in the sixteenth century in Lothian: Buccles ( 1539);Bukeles (1571);Buikles (1584 and 1603); and Bugloss (1680) The Home clan, to which Buglass is affiliated, derives from Patrick, Earl of Dunbar, who lived early in the 13th century. Alexander Home was created a Baron in 1473, and the title was raised to an Earldom by James VI in 1605. Eventually, ithe family of Home of Coldingknow succeeded to the title, and from this, the 14th Earl is directly descended. For political reasons, he resigned his earldom to become Sir Alec Douglas-Home, later Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. In 1729, a Stephen Buglas [sic] was appointed vice tidesman at the port of Dumfries. Due to the geographical position of Roxburghshire, the Buglass name is also common in northern parts of England, such as Northumberland." .

One NuBit is equal to one US dollar in value. It works like many other popular digital currencies without the risk of volatility. NuBits are notable for being the first decentralized cryptocurrency to maintain a $1.00 US price peg for a period of one year, having accomplished it on September 23, 2015. The Nu project is considered a global pioneer in the creation of decentralized stable-value cryptocurrencies. Price is maintained by users placing huge market orders in both sides of 1 USD (or their equivalent in non USD exchange pairs), commonly refereed as sell and buy walls, to support the price within a narrow range of the 1 USD peg. The incentive to do so is the small commission between the market order and the 1 USD peg, usually <1%. Different users compete to be the closest price , so orders are filled with their walls and earn their profit, at the same time strengthening the 1 USD peg. NuBits are the stable part of the Nu Network, the decentralized autonomous organization that started the project." .

It aims at developing a curated resource that gives reliable information about ortholog and paralog assignments, and evolutionary history of various gene families.TreeFam defines a gene family as a group of genes that evolved after the speciation of single-metazoan animals. It also tries to include outgroup genes like yeast (S.cerevisiae and S. pombe) and plant (A. thaliana) to reveal these distant members. TreeFam is also an ortholog database. Unlike other pairwise alignment based ones, TreeFam infers orthologs by means of gene trees. It fits a gene tree into the universal species tree and finds historical duplications, speciations and losses events. TreeFam uses this information to evaluate tree building, guide manual curation, and infer complex ortholog and paralog relations. The basic elements of TreeFam are gene families that can be divided into two parts: TreeFam-A and TreeFam-B families. TreeFam-B families are automatically created. They might contain errors given complex phylogenies. TreeFam-A families are manually curated from TreeFam-B ones. Family names and node names are assigned at the same time. The ultimate goal of TreeFam is to present a curated resource for all the families. TreeFam is being run as a project at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, and its software is housed on Sourceforge as TreeSoft." .

This computational prediction problem is known as Protein subcellular localization prediction. Over the last decade, more than a dozen web servers and computer programs have been developed to attempt to solve this problem. Proteome Analyst is an example of one of the better performing subcellular prediction tools. Proteome Analyst makes predictions for both prokaryotic eukaryotic proteins using a text mining approach.

Another cause may be that as most of them are in their late teens to early twenties they look rather boyish. Although they are sometimes regarded as Korean bish\u014Dnen, their gender is not commonly questioned, nor their sexual orientation. Outside of Korea the concept is also prevalent in China, Taiwan and Japan. The concept is also now recognised throughout Asia through the numerous remakes of Korean dramas in Asian countries as well as the popularity of Korean dramas in Asia including Singapore, Malaysia, Sri Lanka, Indonesia, Thailand and the Philippines." .

A shirtwaist was originally a separate blouse constructed like a shirt; i.e., of shirting fabric with turnover collar and cuffs and a front button closure. In the later Victorian period the term became applied more generally to unlined blouses with relatively simple construction and usually of a cotton or linen fabric, but often highly ornamented with embroidery and lace. From the mid-20th century, shirtwaist referred to a dress with the upper portion (the bodice and sleeves) fashioned like a man's shirt, with a turnover collar and buttons down the front. Different embroidery were added to the shirtwaist, like rhinestones and different patterns." .

Characteristics include common use of hexatonic and heptatonic scales, variety of form, melodic contour, and percussive accompaniment, melodic range averaging between an octave and a twelfth, with rhythmic complexity equal to the Plains Indians musical sub-area. Nettl cites the Kachina dance songs as the most complex songs and the music of Hopi and Zuni as the most complex of the Pueblo, while Tanoan and Keresan music is simpler and intermediate between the Plains and western Pueblos. The music of the Pima and Papago is intermediary between the Plains-Pueblo and the California-Yuman music areas, with melodic movement of the Yuman, though including the rise, and the form and rhythm of the Pueblo. (Nettl 1956, p. 112-113) Work songs are found in Pueblo music, but are otherwise mostly unknown among Native American folk music (Nettl, 1965, p. 152).One well-known melody from the Zuni people is Zuni Sunrise or The Sunrise Call, a song frequently played on Native American flute. This melody was initially collected by Carlos Troyer and published in an arrangement for voice and piano in 1904.Bird impersonation is a major part of the songs. One of the songs goes,Yahah\u00E8-ya-ho-a-na le'a-ne ah-o-nye ah-on-yeh Maa-hanu-yeh hanu-yeh hanu-yeh anu-yeh maa-saaha-nye saaha-ye saaha-ye Another goes Maa-hanu-yeh-saaha-pleb-putin" .

It is commonly used in clothing to manage fullness[clarification needed], as when a full sleeve is attached to the armscye or cuff of a shirt, or when a skirt is attached to a bodice. In simple gathering, parallel rows of running stitches are sewn along one edge of the fabric to be gathered. The stitching threads are then pulled or drawn up so that the fabric forms small folds along the threads. Gathering seams once involved tedious hand sewing of basting, which was time consuming and inefficient, especially with heavy fabric. Now, a quick and easy way to make a gather is to use a wide zigzag stitch with a sewing machine. Both the upper and lower thread are pulled long and placed in front of the sewing machine. Then zigzagging is carefully sewed over top of the two threads without catching the threads as it is sewn. At the end the thread is pulled and is then gathered." .

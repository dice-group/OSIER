It is a hair coloring method that has become increasingly popular as a result of social media and its usage by celebrities.Dip dye originates from the process of tie dyeing clothing (especially T-shirts). Dip-dyeing and the ombre hairstyle are similar, however, dip dyeing usually involves brighter neon colors than an ombre style, which is typically a more blended and natural coloration. Another similar hair coloring technique that is confusing is balayage because it is so similar to ombre, but looks like growing-out highlights." .

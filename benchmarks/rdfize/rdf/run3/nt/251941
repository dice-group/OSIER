It is native to eastern and Central Canada (from Newfoundland to Ontario with isolated populations in Saskatchewan) and the eastern and north-central United States (from Maine west to Minnesota and south as far as Tennessee and North Carolina). Lycopodium hickeyi is very similar to L. obscurum except for a few minor but consistent features: side shoots round rather than flat in cross section, leaves all the same size. The oldest for the taxon is Lycopodium obscurum var. isophyllum. In elevating the plants from varietal level to species level, Wagner et al. opted to forgo the common (but not mandatory) custom of using the old varietal epithet as the new species epithet. They chose instead the name Lycopodium hickeyi while acknowledging the old varietal name as synonym." .

It has also been introduced to the Island of Hawaii, where it was first seen cultivated in 1994, and then wild in 2000. The plant prefers to grow in shaded areas The plant's stem is typically 8-25 centimeters long before branching, usually red in color. The branched portion is 10-25 centimeters, usually at a 45 to 90 degree angle from the stem. In the traditional medicine of Belize, the plant is used to treat bladder infections, skin fungus, and mental illness." .
